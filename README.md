# Signed-32-bit-Q22.10-Vectoring-CORDIC-atan2-in-VHDL
This project implements a signed fixed-point (Q22.10) 32-bit vectoring CORDIC algorithm in VHDL to calculate atan2(y, x) for all quadrants. The design supports signed inputs in two's complement format and outputs a signed angle in the same fixed-point format.
